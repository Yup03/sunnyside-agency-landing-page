### Links


- Live Site URL: [Take a look at the final result here](https://yup03.github.io/sunnyside-agency-landing-page/)

### The challenge

The challenge is that the users would be able to View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size and See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

## My process

I built this website using Semantic HTML5 markup, CSS custom properties, `Flexbox` and `CSS Grid` and it's fully responsive with the `Desktop first` workflow.

### What I learned

From this challenge, I learned how to build `optimal layouts` for Websites And to also use different pictures depending on their device's screen size.

### Useful resources

- [Css portal website](https://www.cssportal.com) helped me to generate a good shape for my Mobile-Navigation using the `clip-path` property
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org) Since the design was provided with `Desktop` and `Mobile` images, `MDN` was a good helping tool when it comes to have a better understanding of the `picture` element.
